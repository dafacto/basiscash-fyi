title: Earn BAC by buying Bonds
intro: Purchase bonds at a premium when BAC is in contraction.
---

When ESD is in contraction—i.e. the TWAP is less than $1—the protocol sells *coupons* at a premium. This means for each 1 ESD worth of coupons, you’ll pay something less than 1 ESD, and later be able to redeem them for 1 ESD, when the protocol is again in expansion.

To pay for coupons, you will “burn” your ESD, thereby destroying them. Burning ESD results in decreasing the total ESD supply, which should have the effect of increasing its market price back towards a value of $1.

Purchasing coupons can be very profitable. For example, if you bought 1 ESD of coupons for 0.75 ESD, and redeemed them for 1 ESD in a week, that’s an annualized return of roughly 1,400%!

What’s the risk? *Purchased coupons expire after 90 epochs, or approximately 30 days.* This means that if ESD doesn’t enter expansion during that time, your coupons expire worthless.

With that as background, here’s how it works:

1.  one
2.	two
3.	three

Now that you’ve learned all about earning BAC and BAS, the last thing to learn about is governance.
